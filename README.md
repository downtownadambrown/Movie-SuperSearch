## Movie SuperSearch App
#### Made by Adam Brown

Movie SuperSearch is a movie metadata aggregator which allows the user to find information by movie title in a streamlined fashion

### Getting Started

* **To install & run the server**
from the root directory run 
`*npm install*`
then
`node server.js`

* **To install & run the client**
from the ./client directory run
`*npm install*`
then
`npm start`

**Things I want to add:**
* a true view templating engine (jade/pug for example)
* a simple script to run nodemon and npm start, i know this is simple just ran out of all time and had to say quits
* split components in React with a better class-like feel throughout the app
* better use of functional programming
* way better output to UI.  I had to do what I had to do with the time I had.
* automated testing of course
* more bells and whistles overall
