## Movie SuperSearch App
#### Made by Adam Brown

Movie SuperSearch is a movie metadata aggregator which allows the user to find information by movie title in a streamlined fashion

### Getting Started

* **To install & run the server**
from the root directory run 
`npm install`
then
`node server.js`

* **To install & run the client**
from the ./client directory run
`npm install`
then
`npm start`

**Things I want to add:**
* a true view templating engine (jade/pug for example)
* split components in React with a better class-like feel throughout the app
* better use of functional programming
* An improved and more robust UI.  I had to do what I had to do with the time I had.
* automated testing with Jest
* more bells and whistles overall
* had a strange issue trying to get eslint functioning, so id like to lint it
